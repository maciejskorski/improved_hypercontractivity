# improved_hypercontractivity
Hypercontractive Inequalities, discovered by Bonami, are convenient and useful results, that relate higher moments of Rademacher chaoses/boolean polynomials (hard to compute exactly) with respect to their variance (trivial to evaluate).  

This repository presents a new progress on improving numeric constants with a novel technique: tensor calculus.
